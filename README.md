## Uppercore
Uppercore is a huge plugin that contains all needs for dev-friendly Spigot development.
With Uppercore, you'll finally be able to create fully configurable and optimized plugins with few lines of code.

## Board
Uppercore provides a Scoreboard Api that wraps the uncomfortable Bukkit one (if you have ever used it you know what I'm talking about).
See how to use it [there](https://github.com/upperlevel/uppercore/wiki/Board). Learning it takes just few minutes!

## Config
Bukkit Configuration Api is usable as it is but works only with Yaml!
What if you have a bare Map (loaded from file or not) and you want to get different types of objects from that?
You just can't without writing verbose code full of instanceof and casts.

That's why we add this big interface to Uppercore.
You can find more information [here](https://github.com/upperlevel/uppercore/wiki/Config).
